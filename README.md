  <h4> Market segmentation becomes a crucial tool for evolving transportation technology such as electric vehicles (EVs) in emerging markets to explore and implement for extensive adoption. EVs adoption is expected to grow phenomenally in near future as low emission and low operating cost vehicle, and thus, it drives a considerable amount of forthcoming academic research curiosity. The main aim of this study is to explore and identify distinct sets of potential buyer segments for EVs based on <i>psychographic, behavioral, and socio-economic</i> characterization by employing an integrated research framework of <i>‘perceived benefits-attitude-intention’</i>.</h4>
